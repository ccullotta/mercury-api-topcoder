My best at a topcoder API challenge

This system is incomplete, but once finished, would handle background operations for users managing access to their physical spaces protected by digital locks/keys (in the form of smartphone app or keychain fob). This project was designed as a back-end management API for a digital lock company. 

The company required custom JWT authentication to be used to verify users, and the finished portion handles security, user registration, email, forgot password, and the begining of user key assignments.

Notes:
Project uses JWT Bearer authentication, and was my first experience dealing with JWT security, the Postman Api client, and a good lesson for asp.net dependency injection. 
That being said, the initial structure of this project was definitely NOT ideal. 

First project dealing with email verification tokens, and GUIDs.

First project realizing why and how to hash passwords, and salting or randomizing hashes. 

First project fully utilizing auto-mapper for data transfer objects

First project with Data-transfer-objects in general
