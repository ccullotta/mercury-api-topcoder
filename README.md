# mercury-api-topcoder
My best at a topcoder API challenge

Notes:
Project uses JWT Bearer authentication, and was my first experience dealing with JWT security, the Postman Api client, and a good lesson for asp.net dependency injection. 
That being said, the initial structure of this project was definitely NOT ideal. 

First project dealing with email verification tokens, and GUIDs.

First project realizing why and how to hash passwords, and salting or randomizing hashes. 

First project fully utilizing auto-mapper for data transfer objects

First project with Data-transfer-objects in general
